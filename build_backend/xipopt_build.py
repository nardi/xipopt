"""The build backend of xipopt, which is meson-python after the JLL wraps are written.

Meson reads the wrap files of `subprojects` once, when it parses `project()`, so wraps that
`meson-jll sync` writes later in the same run stay unknown to it. The first configuration
therefore fails at the first `dependency()` call, though it leaves the wraps behind. This
backend makes that first run itself, so the real run finds them.
